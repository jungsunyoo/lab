#Use one pair of double asterisks for multiple lab members that appear sequentially: **Young ID, Diaz RE, Liu LL**.
#Use &#42; to add an asterisk denoting co-first/corresponding author. Otherwise, bolding of names using **Surname FM** will break.
#For readability of code, start a new line at 140 characters.

#Images and PDFs
